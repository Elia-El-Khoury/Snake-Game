# Snake-Game

# It's a simple snake game similar to the one we had back in the day on old Nokia phones

# pressing 'S' will swap the head and the tail of the snake.

the game starts with 6 bodyparts for the snake and as we play and eat 'apples' the score goes up as the snake body part

the game ends when the snake touches its tail or hits the screen borders.

the snake's body parts are constantly changing color but the head is green it's a feature that I added at the end but the tail could also be a solid color.

we get a GameOver screen with the score:
